# Annotator

A graphical tool for labeling images with bounding boxes and keypoints. Its main advantages over existing tools in the open source space include:

• Support for Windows and Linux via a simple installer
• Instantenous imports/exports, which can take up to an hour on other tools
• Quick actions on one or more selected annotations, undo and redo actions
